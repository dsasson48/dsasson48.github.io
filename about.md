Hi! Iâ€™m a data scientist at [nference](https://nference.ai/) where I work on all sorts of fun projects around healthcare and artificial intelligence. I previously studied at [Macaulay Honors College](https://macaulay.cuny.edu/) and [Harvard](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/) focusing on biochemistry and data science. 

Questions? Interesting ideas to share? Drop me a line. 

Thanks for reading!
