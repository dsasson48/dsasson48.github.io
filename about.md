I'm a freelance data scientist with a background in bioinformatics, and I'm currently working with a Y-combinator backed [company](https://www.kiwibiosciences.com/). With experience spanning large and small startups, government labs, academic research, and professional consulting, I have a diverse skillset that allows me to bring unique perspectives to any project.

During my time in grad school, I organized hackathon events that focused on the intersection of healthcare and AI, and I've published research in peer-reviewed journals and given lectures on various topics related to data science. My educational background includes degrees from [Macaulay Honors College](https://macaulay.cuny.edu/) and [Harvard](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/), where I focused on biochemistry and machine learning.

If you have any questions or interesting ideas to share, feel free to drop me a line. I'm always excited to connect with others who share a passion for data science and its applications in the real world.
