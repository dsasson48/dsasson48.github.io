I am a data scientist specializing in bioinformatics currently working at [Kenvue (J&J Consumer)](https://kenvue.com/) in their Global Product Safety division. With a wealth of experience across diverse settings including large and small startups, government labs, academic research, and professional consulting, I bring a unique perspective to every project. During my time in grad school, I had the opportunity to organize hackathon events that focused on the intersection of healthcare and AI. Additionally, I have published research in peer-reviewed journals and delivered lectures on a wide range of topics across data science. My educational background includes degrees from [Macaulay Honors College](https://macaulay.cuny.edu/) and [Harvard](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/), where I focused on biochemistry and machine learning. If you have any questions or interesting ideas to share, feel free to drop me a line. I'm always excited to connect with others who share a passion for data science and its applications in the real world.
