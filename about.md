Hi there! Thanks for visiting my site.

Iâ€™m a freelance data scientist with a background in bioinformatics, currently working with Y-combinator backed [company](https://www.kiwibiosciences.com/). Previous work spans large and small startups, government labs, academic, and professional consulting. In grad school I ran hackathon events focused on Healthcare + AI. I have published in peer reviewed journals and lead lectures around data science. I previously studied at [Macaulay Honors College](https://macaulay.cuny.edu/) and [Harvard](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/) focusing on biochemistry and machine learning. 

Questions? Interesting ideas to share? Feel free to drop me a line.
